# Serverside Webscripting 1 Course Materials

This collection of slides comprises the course materials of the Serverside Webscripting 1 course, part of the [Professional Bachelor ICT](http://www.ikdoeict.be/) study programme, taught at [Odisee](http://www.odisee.be/), Ghent, Belgium.

The materials have originally been developed by Bram(us) Van Damme who blogs over at [bram.us](http://www.bram.us/) and Twitters as [@bramus](http://twitter.com/bramus). These materials are authored by [Joris Maervoet](https://be.linkedin.com/in/jorismaervoet) in the present fork.

The materials may be used freely, as long as credits to the authors are present and the top right graphical link to [ikdoeict.be](http://www.ikdoeict.be/) remains in place.

The engine powering the slide decks is a customized [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/). More info on this can be found in the first set of slides.
